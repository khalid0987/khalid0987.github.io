## 📚 Description

Machine Learning Warning Systems provides a clear framework for building machine learning systems that support human decision-making. This system emphasizes the importance of warnings over decisions to maintain human agency in uncertain environments. It covers topics like:

- Regimes vs decimals
- Leverage over labels
- Reversible alerts
- Anti-coercion UI patterns
- Auditability
- The “Warning Card” template

This project aims to ensure that machine learning remains a helpful tool while valuing human input.
